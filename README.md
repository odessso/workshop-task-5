Using csv datasheets and data visualisation

Web URL: https://odessso.github.io/workshop-task-5/

## Task Description:
- For this task I wanted to use real data that I could find - I decided that it would be interesting to visually illustrate my screentime. 

## Notes:
- I first had to manually go through my screentime on my phone and convert the hours into minutes so that I could get numbers that didn't have decimal places. That was my first mistake as the tutorial used much smaller numbers wheras my numbers were all in the triple digits. Anyway, I input this into a csv table regardless.
- When I did attempt to make a bar graph I was able to half all the digits so that the bars were all a relative resonable height and fit on the canvas. This, however, wasn't easy when it came to converting the data into visual images to represent the values. I very quickly ran into problems with the bars of data (converted into eye images) would just dissapear endlessly off the screen because the numbers were so large. Really struggled to work this one out.
- I decided to depict the data instead by adding it randomly in bouts of the values, so every 3 seconds, the day values would be added in eye ammounts - for example 383 eyes for the first bout, then add 361 and so on cycling through all the values.

## Problems Faced:
- This one was just overall really challenging to translate my ideas into reality - I really struggled with the minute details of bringing the data to life and retaining certain qualities of how it was presented.
- I wanted to add a counter that would measure how many eyes were on the canvas in order to show how screentime was increasing, however this was so hard and even ChatGPT was no help on this one.
